1st lesson:
We coordinated all roles before the lesson started, no changes were made to the initial suggestion. After break we immediately got to figuring out a theme, and decided on "Flying Pigs", and then gave out who does which paragraph.
James does description, Tea does one argument, and alvaro does the other. We started working at 14.35 -> james works on his paragraph while Tea writes in ´control.txt´ and Alvaro searches for images to import.
