Brainstorming Themes: James thought of the product invisible air, Tea thought of flying pigs and I thought of Self-defence products that look like everyday products. Tea also thought of sustainable computers made up of Wood.
Discussion to decide theme: First we decided to cancel out invisible air due to its lack of creativity.We kept on discussing what topic to pick we ended up cancelling the self defense products and then we voted between the flying pigs and the wooden computer. We couldnt quite decide, tea to much pressure so we decided to ask Siri. Siri had decided that we will make a website about a product that can make pigs fly.
Next i made sure everybody felt good about the topic. This only took a few seconds since everybody agreed.
Now we distributed the working roles: James will do the description of the product, Tea will do one argument on why to buy the product and I will do the second argument. I will also look for suitable pictures. At the end Tea will check Syntax and other Logistics.
